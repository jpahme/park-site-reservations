# National Park Campsite Reservation

This is a scheduling application for National Park site visits. It is a command line interface program and was built using Java and the PostgreSQL database. It contains integration tests. The task for this project was to build a program that a user could use to schedule camping trip and reserve a campsite. Users of the system were to be able to view a list of all of the parks, select one and view all of itâ€™s campgrounds, and book reservations at its available sites.

What I Learned
I learned a lot about databases, and querying databases through this project. Working with dates, and scheduling park visits that did not overlap proved to be very challenging and required me to reinforce my understanding of database structure and design. In addition to all I learned about databases through my work in PostgreSQL, and connecting PostgreSQL with a Java application, a lesson I took away from this project was how to properly compartmentalize things. There were a lot of parameters that needed to be passed around, so I had an inclination to put a lot of things in the same class or interface, but as I have learned in my side projects, abstraction makes the code much more understandable and readable to anyone looking through it (Including myself) who wishes to work on it.
